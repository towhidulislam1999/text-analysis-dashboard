## 📊 Sample Data Available

Sample datasets are now available in the `/data` directory to help you get started with the project:

- **sample-survey.csv**: A placeholder CSV file containing example survey responses from Bangladesh, Japan, and Kenya
- **README.md**: Comprehensive documentation about the sample datasets, column descriptions, and usage instructions

These sample files demonstrate the expected data format and can be used for:
- Testing the dashboard functionality
- Understanding the data structure
- Development and prototyping
- Learning how to work with cross-cultural AI interaction data

For more details about the sample datasets, see the [data directory README](data/README.md).

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- R 4.0+ (for statistical modeling)
- Node.js 14+ (for dashboard frontend)
- Git

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/towhidulislam1999/cross-cultural-ai-research.git
cd cross-cultural-ai-research
```

2. **Install Python dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set up R environment**

```r
install.packages(c("SmartPLS", "lavaan", "semTools", "tidyverse"))
```

4. **Install dashboard dependencies**

```bash
cd dashboard/frontend
npm install
```

5. **Run the application**

```bash
# Start the analytics backend
python analysis/data-processor.py

# Launch the dashboard
cd dashboard/frontend
npm start
```

## 📈 Usage

### Running Analysis

```bash
# Generate descriptive statistics
python analysis/descriptive-stats.py --countries BD,JP,KE

# Run SEM analysis
Rscript analysis/sem-modeling.R

# Create comparative visualizations
python analysis/cross-cultural-analysis.py --output dashboard/data/
```

### Accessing the Dashboard

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` after setup
2. Select countries for comparison using the dropdown menu
3. Explore different visualization modules:
   - Trust level comparisons
   - Demographic breakdowns
   - Adoption pattern analysis
